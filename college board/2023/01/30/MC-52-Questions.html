<ul>
  <li>Overall got a 44/52 on the mc</li>
  <li>Topics I got wrong:
    <ul>
      <li>2.A: Apply the meaning of specific operators.</li>
      <li>2.B: Determine the result or output based on statement execution order in a code segment without method calls (other than output).</li>
      <li>2.C: Determine the result or output based on the statement execution order in a code segment containing method calls.</li>
      <li>5.A: Describe the behavior of a given segment of program code.</li>
      <li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Overall, it seems that all of the questions that I missed had to do with trouble shooting code and spotting errors</li>
  <li>In the future, I should work on getting better at spotting errors in code and seeing what is causing a specific error</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Q2:</strong> 
Assume that mat has been declared as a 4×4
 array of integers and has been initialized to contain all 1s. Consider the following code segment.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>int n = mat.length;
for (int j = 1; j &lt; n; j++)
{
    for (int k = 1; k &lt; n; k++)
    {
        mat[j][k] = mat[j - 1][k] + mat[j][k - 1];
    }
}
What is the value of mat[2][2] after the code segment has completed execution?
</code></pre></div></div>
<ul>
  <li>Notes: I said that the answer was 4 but it was actually 6</li>
  <li>I should’ve wrote out all of the outputs on paper</li>
  <li>I was unsure on the answer and moved on because of time</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Q6:</strong>
<img src="/Krish-CSA/images/q6.png" alt="" title="MC results"></p>
<ul>
  <li>Because the algorithm uses a for-each loop to traverse the rows, the row index is not being stored.</li>
  <li>I chose that “The row index of an element with the largest value in the two-dimensional array”</li>
  <li>Answer was “The column index of an element with the largest value in the two-dimensional array”</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Q7:</strong>
Consider the following method.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>/** Precondition: Strings one and two have the same length. */
public static String combine(String one, String two)
{
String res = "";
for (int k = 0; k &lt; one.length(); k++)
{
if (one.substring(k, k + 1).equals(two.substring(k, k + 1)))
{
res += one.substring(k, k + 1);
}
else
{
res += "0";
}
}
return res;
}
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>What is returned as a result of the call combine(“10110”, “01100”) ?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I said that the answer was “00000”</li>
  <li>The answer was “00100”</li>
  <li>What I said would be the result for the method call combine(“00000”, “11111”), for example.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Q29:</strong>
Consider the code segment below.
int a = 1988;
int b = 1990;
String claim = “ that the world’s athletes “ +
“competed in Olympic Games in “;
String s = “It is “ + true + claim + a +
“ but “ + false + claim + b + “.”;
System.out.println(s);
What, if anything, is printed when the code segment is executed?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I sad that the answer was “It is trueclaima but falseclaimb.”</li>
  <li>The answer was “It is true that the world’s athletes competed in Olympic Games in 1988 but false that the world’s athletes competed in Olympic Games in 1990.”</li>
  <li>I missed the fact that the values were from the concatenation and not the variables themselves</li>
</ul>
