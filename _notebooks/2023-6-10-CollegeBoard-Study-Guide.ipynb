    "\n",
    "This unit is a very important unit to all of Java. Without primitives, literally nothing could be calculated or produced, and the whole purpose of coding would be gone. While it may be the simplest of the Units, it one hundred percent is the most important. It is the backbone of this entire course, so we should make sure that our understanding of the language is as high as possible.\n",

    "# Unit 2: Using Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "A very important part of Java is known as Object Oriented Programming. In this unit, we further explored this concept. This allows Java to be a very powerful language for backend development especially, with many uses and whatnot. OOP allows Java to be very good at things like robotics as a programming language for robots. "
