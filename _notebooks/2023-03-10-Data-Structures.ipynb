    "# Methods and Control Structures\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "- A method in Java is a block of code that, when called, performs specific actions mentioned in it. \n",
    "- For instance, if you have written instructions to draw a circle in the method, it will do that task. \n",
    "- You can insert values or parameters into methods, and they will only be executed when called.\n",
    "- A method is similar to a function in other programming languages such as python \n",
    "\n",
    "### Control Structures \n",
    "- Control Structures can be considered as the building blocks of computer programs. \n",
    "- They are commands that enable a program to “take decisions”, following one path or another. \n",
    "- A program is usually not limited to a linear sequence of instructions since during its process it may bifurcate, repeat code or bypass sections.\n",

    "- Fits within data types because contains arrays which is a data type \n",
    "\n",
    "- Takeaway: most code segments no matter what they are on have to do with methods and control structures\n",

    "## Random\n",
    "- Math.random\n",
    "- Gives value between 0 and 1 \n",
    "- To get a random value between 7 and 9, double a  Math.random value and add 7 to it\n",
    "\n",
    "## Do nothing by value\n",
    "- You're basically changing a variable but the variable doesn't actually change because it is changing the subvalue and not the actual value\n",
    "- Changing a variable only happens at a large scale\n",
    "  - Can't do it locally\n",
    "\n",
    "## Int by Reference\n",
    "- The int changes its value even though you are doing it locally\n",
    "- Basically says theres a way to get around the fact that you cant edit variables locally\n",
