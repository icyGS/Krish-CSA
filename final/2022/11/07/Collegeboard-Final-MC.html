<ul>
  <li>My overall score was a 34/40 on the MC</li>
  <li>Skills that I got wrong:
    <ul>
      <li>1.B: Determine code that would be used to complete code segments.</li>
      <li>2.B: Determine the result or output based on statement execution order in a code segment without method calls (other than output).</li>
      <li>2.C: Determine the result or output based on the statement execution order in a code segment containing method calls.</li>
      <li>4.A: Use test-cases to find errors or validate results.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="questions">
<a class="anchor" href="#questions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Questions</h1>
<p><strong>Q10:</strong> Consider the following instance variable and methods. You may assume that data has been initialized with length &gt; 0. The methods are intended to return the index of an array element equal to target, or -1 if no such element exists.
<img src="/Krish-CSA/images/q10.jpg" alt="" title=" "></p>

<p>For which of the following test cases will the call seqSearchRec(5) always result in an error?</p>

<ol>
  <li>data contains only one element.</li>
  <li>data does not contain the value 5.</li>
  <li>data contains the value 5 multiple times.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>I chose 1 only but the answer was 2 only</li>
  <li>Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>I could not understand how to even approach the question</li>
      <li>I now understand that if the value 5 were not present, it would not be possible for it to run as there would be an error</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Q11:</strong> Consider the following instance variable and methods. You may assume that data has been initialized with length &gt; 0. The methods are intended to return the index of an array element equal to target, or -1 if no such element exists.
<img src="/Krish-CSA/images/q11.jpg" alt="" title=" "></p>

<ul>
  <li>I chose <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if (last &lt; data.length) return -1</code> but the answer was <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if (last &lt; 0) return -1;</code>
</li>
  <li>Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>I didn’t realize that the last element had to be less than 0</li>
      <li>In reality, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">last &lt; data.length</code> will always return true on the first call, making it clearly false</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Q12:</strong> What is returned as a result of the call mystery(“computer”) ?
<img src="/Krish-CSA/images/q12.jpg" alt="" title=" "></p>

<ul>
  <li>I selected the answer “cmue” when in reality the answer was “optr”</li>
  <li>Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>I didn’t read that the index of k started at 1 and not 0</li>
      <li>I needed to read better</li>
      <li>I got the correct answer assuming that k started at 0, so I should do a better job reading and I would be fine</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Q21:</strong> Consider the following method, which is intended to return the element of a 2-dimensional array that is closest in value to a specified number, val.
<img src="/Krish-CSA/images/q21.jpg" alt="" title=" ">
Which of the following could be used to replace / * missing code * / so that findClosest will work as intended?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I selected <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Math.abs (num - minDiff) &lt; minDiff</code> but the answer was <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Math.abs (num - val) &lt; minDiff</code>
</li>
  <li>Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>To find the closest value to the value, you need to find the difference between the num and val rather than the num and the minDiff</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Q23:</strong> What will the contents of animals be as a result of calling manipulate?
<img src="/Krish-CSA/images/q23a.jpg" alt="" title=" "></p>

<p>Assume that animals has been instantiated and initialized with the following contents.
<img src="/Krish-CSA/images/q23b.jpg" alt="" title=" "></p>

<ul>
  <li>I chose [“baboon”, “bear”, “zebra”, “bass”, “cat”, “koala”] but the answer is [“bear”, “zebra”, “bass”, “cat”, “koala”, “baboon”]</li>
  <li>Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>I forgot that the later letters than just the first letter could be “b”</li>
      <li>Notes:
        <ul>
          <li>Only 1 iteration of this loop would occur now</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Q24:</strong> Consider the following code segment.
<img src="/Krish-CSA/images/q24.jpg" alt="" title=" ">
What is printed as a result of executing the code segment?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I chose 5, but the answer was 7</li>
  <li>Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>I just had an error somewhere in my calculations, causing me to get 5 instead of 7</li>
      <li>The value of the newArray is 7 at (0,2)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
