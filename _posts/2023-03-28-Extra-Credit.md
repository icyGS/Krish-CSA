# Reflection
- From this amazing presentation I learned that your grades ndo not define you. You can compeltely fail a class but then go on and do amazing. Youy can get a degree. You can succeed. These people had so many challenges, so many difficulties, and yet got over them. CSUSM seems really cool. The amazing opportunities there along with the small campus and interconnectedness makes the college really cool. The amazing majors and whatnot make this a really good college to attend.
