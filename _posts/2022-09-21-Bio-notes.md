- Speciation: When a species splits into more species
- Adaptive radiation: 1 species becomes many 
- Divergent evolution: 1 species becomes 2

# Ways for separation to occur
## Pre-zygotic
- Habitat (ecological) isolation 
- temporal (time/seasonal)
- behavioral
- mechanical
- gametic (broadcast spawners: external fertilization (usually aquatic))
  - Sex cells 

## Post-zygotic
- reduced hybrid fertility
  - Horse and donkey together can only make mules, but mules cannot mate mules, only horse and donkey together 
  - hybrid can live but cannot reproduce
- reduced hybrid viability
  - Gets to a certain point in development, but most likely will die before reproductive age
  - hybrid can live but next generation will be very weak
  - breakdown in ability to sustain 
- hybrid breakdown

Basically organism is formed but cannot live because of one of these three things

# Allopatric
- pop is split into two and isolated (by a barrier)

# Sympatric
- together
- plants 
- polyploid
- (many)(chromosome set #)
