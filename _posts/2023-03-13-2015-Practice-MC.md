# What I learned
- Overall got a 34/39 on the mc
- Topics I got wrong:
  - 1.B: Determine code that would be used to complete code segments.
  - 2.C: Determine the result or output based on the statement execution order in a code segment containing method calls.
  - 2.D: Determine the number of times a code segment will execute.
  - 
- Overall, it seems that all of the questions that I missed had to do with trouble shooting code and spotting errors
- In the future, I should work on getting better at spotting errors in code and seeing what is causing a specific error

**Q3:** 
Consider the following definition.
Which of the following code segments produces the output 123456 ?
```
- Notes: I said that the answer was E but it was A
- I should've wrote out all of the outputs on paper 
- I was unsure on the answer and moved on because of time

**Q6:**
Consider the following two classes.

What is printed as a result of executing the following code segment?
- Because the algorithm uses a for-each loop to traverse the rows, the row index is not being stored.
- I chose that "The row index of an element with the largest value in the two-dimensional array" 
- Answer was "The column index of an element with the largest value in the two-dimensional array"

**Q7:**
Consider the following method.

What is printed as a result of executing the following code segment?

- I said that the answer was "00000" 
- The answer was "00100"
- What I said would be the result for the method call combine("00000", "11111"), for example.

**Q28:**
Consider the code segment below.
int a = 1988;
int b = 1990;
String claim = " that the world’s athletes " +
"competed in Olympic Games in ";
String s = "It is " + true + claim + a +
" but " + false + claim + b + ".";
System.out.println(s);
What, if anything, is printed when the code segment is executed?

- I sad that the answer was "It is trueclaima but falseclaimb."
- The answer was "It is true that the world’s athletes competed in Olympic Games in 1988 but false that the world’s athletes competed in Olympic Games in 1990."
- I missed the fact that the values were from the concatenation and not the variables themselves
